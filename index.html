    <h1> A Day Of Fun In Melbourne!</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>You have to go to <a href="https://lunapark.com.au/">Luna Park</a>, it's one of the coolest theme park in the world and you can get in for the whole day for the low low price of $55. It's full of many fun rides that can easily fill a whole day of fun there are also many souvenirs that you can buy at an assortment of different places around the theme park. But unfortunately you can't stay here all day because there is so much more of Melbourne for you to explore. </h2>

        <h3>The penguins at <a href="https://www.parks.vic.gov.au/places-to-see/parks/st-kilda-pier-and-breakwater/attractions/little-penguins">St Kilda beach</a> are some of the cutest animalds you will ever see in your life. You can't find penguins many other places in the world and here is a great place to get close up with them. Although you can't feed them you can still come within 3 meters of them within the viewing area. This great attraction is also only a ten minute walk from Luna Park meaning its fast to get there and leaves plenty of time for the last activity of the day.  </h3> 
        <h4>The <a href="https://www.mcg.org.au/">MCG</a> is a great place to end the day watching a classic game of the Australian Football League (AFL). You can't see a game of AFL in any other country, thats why coming to melbourne and going to the MCG is one of the best experiences you will have in your lifetime, And if footy isnt the sport for you, don't worry, there are so many other things to do at half time, for example you can go to the <a href="https://www.mcg.org.au/things-to-do/australian-sports-museum">Australian Sports Museum </a>, which is full of sports history and interactive exhibits full of sporting challenges. </h4>
